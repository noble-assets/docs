# `x/blockibc` IBC Transfer Middleware

Block IBC is [ICS-20](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc/blob/main/spec/app/ics-020-fungible-token-transfer/README.md) middleware to prevent IBC forwarding when the asset is the issuance asset of a tokenfactory for the following cases:
- The tokenfactory has paused the movement of funds for the asset
- The tokenfactory has blacklisted the sender or the receiver of the IBC transfer

This currently applies to the `tokenfactory` and `fiattokenfactory` modules.
