# Noble Upgrades & Maintenance

The Noble blockchain (“Noble”) houses a multisignature wallet, referred to as the Noble Maintenance Multisig (or “NMM”), that has the following three functionalities:

- Upgrade Authority
- Parameter Changes
- IBC maintenance

**Upgrade Authority**

A standard multisignature application forms the NMM which is able to initiate a chain upgrade when a breaking protocol change requires upgrading the chain binary. The NMM uses an on-chain procedure to indicate to the validators to halt the protocol running the Noble chain and which restarts the blockchain with a new binary. Importantly, validators have discretionary authority to follow those instructions. If 1/3 + 1 of the voting power of the Noble chain refuses to follow these upgrade instructions, the chain halts.

**Parameter Changes**

The NMM has the ability to initiate parameter changes. This authority is distinct from the upgrade functionality as it would not require the Noble validators to run a new chain binary. A parameter change would automatically be introduced into the state machine of the Noble chain.

**IBC Connection Maintenance**

The NMM has the ability to re-establish IBC connections that have expired. Any such action related to an IBC connection is achieved automatically upon execution by the NMM.

**Configuration of the NMM**

The NMM is a 5/7 multisignature wallet for passing a proposal to fulfill the three key functions discussed above. The configuration of the NMM includes the Noble corporate entity and core validator partners. A key objective of the NMM is to achieve a reasonable level of geographic diversity among NMM members for resilience. The current geographies are noted as follows:

- Binary Holdings: Switzerland
- Chorus One: Switzerland
- Cosmostation: Korea
- Iqlusion: USA
- Luganodes: Switzerland
- Noble (the organization): Canada/USA
- Strangelove: USA

NMM constituents will be rotated in and out of the multisignature wallet over time.
