# Noble Maintenance Multisig

## Permissioned Network

Noble is a permissioned network. Unlike permissionless Proof of Stake chains, the only way of participating in the Noble mainnet is through a delegation of staking tokens by the Noble Maintenance Multisig (NMM).

We're currently capped for participation and chose validators based on number of factors including

- Running validator on Cosmos Hub
- Geographic distribution of nodes
- Community contributions (educational content, events/marketing presence, etc)
- Infrastructure development (block explorers, wallets, core Cosmos stack development, testing, etc)
- Significant ATOM stake (1%+ voting power)
