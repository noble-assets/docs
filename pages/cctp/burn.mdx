# Noble CCTP Send

## Deposit for Burn

To send USDC from Noble to another chain via CCTP, use the `deposit-for-burn` or `deposit-for-burn-with-caller` command from Noble.

```bash
nobled tx cctp deposit-for-burn \
    10000000 # 10000000uusdc = 10 USDC \
    0 # Ethereum \
    0x0123CA15daDb45E47B270fe025aa5B3BcbF4E5ab # address on Ethereum to receive the USDC \
    uusdc # token to burn \
    --from noble1tq944l2tgxugwvu74yke37yt7pa27p8467rxg5 # Transaction signer
```

## Deposit for Burn with Caller

The `deposit-for-burn-with-caller` command is the same as `deposit-for-burn` except that it allows you to restrict the address of the user/relayer that will execute the receive message on the destination chain. This is useful if you want to self relay the message.

```bash
nobled tx cctp deposit-for-burn-with-caller \
    10000000 # 10000000uusdc = 10 USDC \
    0 # Ethereum \
    0x0123CA15daDb45E47B270fe025aa5B3BcbF4E5ab # address on Ethereum to receive the USDC \
    uusdc # token to burn \
    0x0123CA15daDb45E47B270fe025aa5B3BcbF4E5ab # address of the user/relayer that will execute the receive message on the destination chain \
    --from noble1tq944l2tgxugwvu74yke37yt7pa27p8467rxg5 # Transaction signer
```
