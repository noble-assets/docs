Jester is a sidecar application designed to be run by the Noble validator set. It facilitates the implementation of the Noble Dollar ($USDN), powered by M0.

:::note

Jester is not needed by node operators. Only validators need to run Jester.

:::

## What does Jester do?

Jester acts as a relayer listening for `$USDN` transfers between Ethereum and Noble.

As events are observed, Jester accumulates Wormhole VAA's (Verified Action Approvals).
These VAA's are handed off to Noble validators and submitted on-chain.

For all information around Jester including installation, configuration and usage, please refer to Jesters <GitHubButton repoUrl="https://github.com/noble-assets/jester"/>.
