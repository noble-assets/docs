We offer USDN integrations for a range of different use cases.

## Developers

Integrating USDN on blockchain networks comprises the following 3 steps:

1. **Connection** \
  Ensure your network has an open IBC channel or Hyperlane route to Noble.

2. **Coordination** \
  [Contact us](https://www.noble.xyz/#contact) to specify where the rewards should be sent.
  This can be a smart contract, multisig, DAO treasury, or any other address.

3. **Configuration** \
  The yield distribution will accrue to the specified address,
  once Noble validators have registered it in Noble's on-chain state.
  Upon receiving, integrators have full control over how to distribute or utilize the yield within their ecosystem.

### Example Rewards Distribution Strategies
- **Validator Rewards**: Distribute Treasury rewards to validators.
- **User Incentives**: Pass rewards directly to USDN holders on your network.
- **Protocol Treasury**: Send rewards to your DAO treasury for protocol development.

### Supported Network Types
  - Cosmos SDK chains (via IBC).
  - Ethereum and EVM-compatible chains (via Hyperlane).
  - Custom integrations available for other networks. [Contact our team](https://www.noble.xyz/#contact)
  for a custom solution based on your blockchain's state machine and canonical bridge.
