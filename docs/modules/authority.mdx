The üîí**Authority Module** allows a designated multi-signature address, in this case the 
***Noble Maintenance Multisig (NMM)***, to execute 
privileged operations on the chain.

Each module has the ability to assign the `Authority` module as its authority.
In Noble's case, this happens in the [app.yaml](https://github.com/noble-assets/noble/blob/main/app.yaml).

Because Noble does not have a Governance Module, the Authority module is used to
facilitate governance actions. To learn more about the NMM and Noble governance, 
check out the [Governance](../governance/index.mdx) section.

## Usage

The module allows for arbitrary execution of messages.

```sh
nobled tx authority execute <FILE.json> --from nmm
```

However the modules primary use case will likely be used for `software upgrades`, `ibc client recovery`, and `parameter changes`.

Helper commands are included for some of these scenarios.

```sh
# software upgrade
nobled tx authority software-upgrade <name> [--upgrade-height <height>] [--upgrade-info <info>] --from nmm

# recover IBC client
nobled tx authority recover-client [subject-client-id] [substitute-client-id] --from nmm
```

### üë§ Transfer Ownership

In cases where the authority address needs to be rotated, the current owner can transfer ownership to a new address.

```sh
nobled tx authority transfer-ownership <new-owner> --from <current-owner>
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** The new owner **must execute** `accept-ownership` to finalize the transfer.

```sh
nobled tx authority accept-ownership --from <new-owner>
```

## Queries

Query for the current owner of the authority module.

```sh
nobled q authority owner
```

Query for the current pending owner of the authority module. This is only relevant if a transfer of ownership is in progress.

```sh
nobled q authority pending-owner
```
