The **Globalfee Module** allows for flexible fee management on the Noble blockchain. 
It provides the ability to **bypass certain message types** from paying transaction 
fees while ensuring non-bypassed messages comply with minimum required gas prices.

Because Noble does not have a Governance Module, updating parameters for this module 
must be broadcasted by the [Authority Module](./authority.mdx) controlled by the [NMM](../governance/).

## Usage

### Update Bypass Messages
Allows an authorized address to specify which messages can bypass required gas fees.

For example, broadcasting the following message will allow all bank sends and IBC client update messages to be exempt from gas fees:

```sh
nobled tx globalfee update-bypass-messages /cosmos.bank.v1beta1.MsgSend /ibc.core.client.v1.MsgUpdateClient
```

### Update Minimum Gas Prices
Allows an authorized address to update the minimum required gas prices for **non-bypassed messages**.

Example:

```sh
nobled tx globalfee update-gas-prices '0.01uusdc,0.02ibc/EF48E6B1A1A19F47ECAEA62F5670C37C0580E86A9E88498B7E393EB6F49F33C0'
```

‚ö†Ô∏è This message will overwrite the entire list, it does not append to it.
