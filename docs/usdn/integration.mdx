Integrating USDN varies based on the type of user and their use case.

## Developers

Integrating USDN on blockchain networks comprises the following 3 steps:
1. Ensure your network has an open IBC channel or Hyperlane route to Noble.

2. [Contact us](https://www.noble.xyz/#contact) to specify where the rewards should be sent. This could be a smart contract, multisig, DAO treasury, or any other address.

3. The rewards distribution is registered by Noble validators to accrue to the specified address. Once received, integrators have full control over how to distribute or utilize the yield within their ecosystem.

### Example Rewards Distribution Strategies
- **Validator Rewards**: Distribute Treasury rewards to validators
- **User Incentives**: Pass rewards directly to USDN holders on your network
- **Protocol Treasury**: Send rewards to your DAO treasury for protocol development

### Supported Network Types
  - Cosmos SDK chains (via IBC)
  - Ethereum and EVM-compatible chains (via Hyperlane)
  - Custom integrations available for other networks. [Contact our team](https://www.noble.xyz/#contact) for a custom solution based on your blockchain's state machine and canonical bridge
