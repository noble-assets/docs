Integrating USDN varies based on the type of user and their use case:

### For Developers

Integrating USDN on blockchain networks is comprised of the following 3 steps:
1. Ensure your network has an open IBC channel or Hyperlane route to Noble.

2. [Contact us](https://www.noble.xyz/#contact) to specify where the rewards should be sent. This could be a smart contract, multisig, DAO treasury, or any other address.

3. The rewards distribution is registered by Noble validators to accrue to the address of choice.

#### Supported Network Types:
  - Cosmos SDK chains (via IBC)
  - Ethereum and EVM-compatible chains (via Hyperlane)
  - Custom integrations available for other networks. [Contact our team](https://www.noble.xyz/#contact) for a custom solution based on your blockchain's state machine and canonical bridge.


### For Institutions
For institutions without existing blockchain infrastructure who are interested in integrating USDN, please [contact our team](https://www.noble.xyz/#contact) for tailored integration guidance specific to your stack and requirements.
