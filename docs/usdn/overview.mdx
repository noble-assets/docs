# Overview
[Noble Dollar (USDN)](https://dollar.noble.xyz/) is a yield-bearing stablecoin, fully backed by short-term U.S. Treasury Bills, that automatically accrues yield (~4% as of writing) through a **rebasing
mechanism.** 

Unlike traditional stablecoins, USDN holders earn yield simply by holding the token in their wallet - no staking or additional actions required.

USDN is an implementation of $M of the [M0 protocol](https://www.m0.org/). M0 is a permissionless platform built on Ethereum for the purpose of issuing application-specific stablecoins.
Each $M token is backed 1:1 by risk-free reserves. Because USDN is an extension of $M, the [collateral backing $M](https://dashboard.m0.org/) extends to USDN as well.

What sets USDN apart from other yield-bearing stablecoins is its feature of [**'Composable Yield'**](https://www.noble.xyz/blog/composable-yield-a-new-paradigm-for-stablecoins), **which allows the integrators of USDN (and not the issuer) to decide who gets the yield and how its used.**

## How USDN Works
By locking $M on Ethereum through [M0’s Portal bridge](https://docs.m0.org/home/technical-documentations/m-portal/core-bridging-process/) (powered by [Wormhole’s Native Token Transfer](https://wormhole.com/products/native-token-transfers)), Noble can mint USDN on‐chain and programmatically direct the underlying yield back to its holders.

USDN uses a rebasing mechanism **where the token supply adjusts to reflect yield accrual**. When yield is distributed, new tokens are minted proportionally to existing holdings. Your USDN balance increases automatically as yield accrues, maintaining your purchasing power
while generating returns. The protocol tracks two key values:                                                                                                      
- **Present Amount:** Your visible token balance that increases with yield.                                                            
- **Principal Amount:** Your underlying stake that remains constant.                                                                                         

## Key Features

- **Native Yield:** Earn Treasury yield simply by holding USDN.
- **Composable Yield for Integrators**: Stream cross-chain yield from Noble to your network via [IBC](https://ibcprotocol.dev/) or [Hyperlane](https://hyperlane.xyz/).
- **Treasury-Backed Collateral**: 100% collateralized by short-term U.S. Treasury Bills (generating ~4% as of writing).
- **Developer Sovereignty**: Full programmatic control over yield allocation on your network.

## Collateral

USDN is backed by short-term U.S. Treasury Bills held in Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs). **As of writing, USDN has a collateralization ratio of 102%.**
