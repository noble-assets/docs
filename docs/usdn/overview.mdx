# Overview
[Noble Dollar (USDN)](https://dollar.noble.xyz/) is a yield-bearing stablecoin, fully backed by short-term U.S. Treasury Bills, that automatically accrues rewards (~4% as of writing) through a **rebasing
mechanism.** 

Unlike traditional stablecoins, USDN holders earn rewards by holding the token in their wallet and manually claiming the accrued rewards.

USDN is an implementation of $M of the [M0 protocol](https://www.m0.org/). M0 is a permissionless platform built on Ethereum for the purpose of issuing application-specific stablecoins.
Each $M token is backed 1:1 by risk-free reserves. Because USDN is an extension of $M, the [collateral backing $M](https://dashboard.m0.org/) extends to USDN as well.

What sets USDN apart from other yield-bearing stablecoins is its feature of [**'Composable Yield'**](https://www.noble.xyz/blog/composable-yield-a-new-paradigm-for-stablecoins), **which allows the integrators of USDN (and not the issuer) to decide who gets the rewards and how they're used.**

## How USDN Works
By locking $M on Ethereum through [M0’s Portal bridge](https://docs.m0.org/home/technical-documentations/m-portal/core-bridging-process/) (powered by [Wormhole’s Native Token Transfer](https://wormhole.com/products/native-token-transfers)), Noble can mint USDN on‐chain and programmatically direct the underlying rewards back to its holders.

USDN uses a rebasing mechanism **where the token supply adjusts to reflect rewards accrual**. When rewards are distributed, new tokens are minted proportionally to existing holdings. Your USDN balance increases automatically as rewards accrue, maintaining your purchasing power
while generating returns.                                                                                      

## Key Features

- **Native Rewards:** Earn Treasury yield simply by holding USDN.
- **Composable Rewards for Integrators**: Stream cross-chain rewards from Noble to your network via [IBC](https://ibcprotocol.dev/) or [Hyperlane](https://hyperlane.xyz/).
- **Treasury-Backed Collateral**: 100% collateralized by short-term U.S. Treasury Bills (generating ~4% as of writing).
- **Developer Sovereignty**: Full programmatic control over rewards allocation on your network.

## Collateral

USDN is backed by short-term U.S. Treasury Bills held in Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs). **As of writing, USDN has a collateralization ratio of 102%.**
