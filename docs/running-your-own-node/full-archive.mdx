#### You have two options when it comes to syncing or restoring a Noble full archive node.

## Sync from Archival Snapshot (recommended)

#### We leverage <PolkachuIcon /> Polkachu's Archival snapshot service! 

You can download the latest snapshot [here](https://polkachu.com/archive_snapshots/noble). 

Then follow the [snapshot instructions](https://polkachu.com/tendermint_snapshots/noble).

To ensure your node retains all of its state, you will need to set `pruning` to `"nothing"` in `app.toml`:

```toml title="$HOME/.noble/config/app.toml"
pruning = "nothing"
```

Also, ensure `indexer` is set to `"kv"` in `config.toml`, which should be the default.

```toml title="$HOME/.noble/config/config.toml"
[tx_index]
indexer = "kv"
```

## Manually Sync from Genesis

Be ready, this is a tedious and time consuming process as you are starting from block 0!

Clone repo, then download `v1.0.0` of Noble:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/noble-assets/noble.git
cd noble
git checkout v1.0.0
make install
```

Initialize the node:

```sh
nobled init <moniker>
```

Download the genesis file:

```sh
curl -o $HOME/.noble/config/genesis.json https://raw.githubusercontent.com/noble-assets/docs/main/genesis_files/mainnet/genesis.json
```

In your `config.toml` add a comma separated list of peers that also are archival nodes.

Noble's peer: `<coming soon>`


Also, ensure `indexer` is set to `"kv"`, which should be the default.

```toml title="$HOME/.noble/config/config.toml"
[p2p]

persistent_peers = ""

...

[tx_index]

indexer = "kv"
```

To ensure your node retains all of its state, you will need to set `pruning` to `"nothing"` in `app.toml`:

```toml title="$HOME/.noble/config/app.toml"
pruning = "nothing"
```

Start your node:

```sh  
nobled start
```

Your node will start to sync. It will halt when it hits an upgrade height.

Reference this [chart](../chain-upgrades/mainnet.mdx) to see heights and versions.

Once your node halts and is waiting for an upgrade, stop the node, update the binary to the next version, and start it again.

Be sure to pay attention to the `--halt-height` in the chart, as you will need to occasionally set that value when upgrading.

```sh
git checkout <next-version>
make install
nobled start
```

*We wish you success on this journey*
