## Introduction

Noble is an [application-specific blockchain](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/learn/intro/why-app-specific) 
built on the Cosmos SDK, purpose-built for asset issuance with a focus on stablecoins and real-world assets (RWAs). As an 
IBC-enabled chain, Noble ensures seamless interoperability across the Cosmos ecosystem enabling fast and secure transactions.
Additionally, Noble has implemented Circle's [Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP)](https://www.circle.com/cross-chain-transfer-protocol) 
to facilitate transfers across multiple blockchain networks.

You can learn more about the assets we offer [here](https://www.noble.xyz/#assets)!
