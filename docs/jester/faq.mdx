<Collapse summary="I'm seeing a lot of <code>info</code> level logs with the error: <code>404:Not Found - waiting for wormhole to pickup tx.</code>">
This is expected and OK âœ….  
Jester is waiting for Wormhole to pick up the transaction, which requires finality on Ethereum.

<Collapse summary="What happens if I'm a Validator and I don't run Jester?">
You will see the following error each time you propose a new block:

```log
8:49AM ERR failed to get vote extension from Jester. Ensure Jester is configured and running! err="unavailable: dial tcp [::1]:9091: connect: connection refused" module=server
```

Currently, there are no other consequences.
